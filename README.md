 Basic Flow of Events 
 
When the application loads, the user is asked to enter a password before being able to view any details or pricing of the workshops. The password is ‘iLuvVisualC#’. If the user enters an incorrect password, they should be notified of the error & asked to try again. If the user enters the wrong password on four occasions the application closes with a message to the user.  
On entering the correct password, the user can select an event from a ListBox control and an event location from another (each booking must contain an event and a location). The user can also select a meal option, and whether the attendee wishes to receive a printed certificate on the completion of the event.  When the user clicks the ‘Display’ button, the application displays all of the details of the 

chosen event along with registration cost, the lodging cost, the optional costs and overall workshop cost in an appropriate control. 
If the prospective client wishes to proceed, the user clicks the ‘Book’ button, after which a Message Box with a formatted message confirming the completion of the booking is displayed. This confirmation message contains the name and location of the event booked along with total cost.  Note: payment is processed separately from the application. 
If the user wishes to check how many bookings have been processed, they can click the ‘Summary Button’ and the application displays the total number of bookings processed, the total registration fees, the total lodging fees, the value of options chosen and the average revenue per booking.
